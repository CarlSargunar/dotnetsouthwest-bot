# Importing LUIS application
 In order to get your own copy of the LUIS model working with the bot you will need to head over to www.luis.ai and click the "new application" button (after signing in) - Select the "import application" option and upload the JSON file found in the "luis-model" folder.
 
 Publish your LUIS application and update the "LuisModel" attribute with your own app key and secret... done!
 
 Thanks for coming along.
